LOL 😆 Cant stop laughing at this. 

I wanted to prank my friends with this meme using voice call so I thought Twilio would be the perfect choice for my project.


1. Clone the repository to your local machine
2. Install dependencies using **npm install**
3. Create a **.env** file and add your Twilio Phone Number, Account SID, and Auth Token from the Twilio Console
4. Start the application by running **node index.js**


## Important Info

You need to verify your friend's number through the [Twilio console](https://console.twilio.com/us1/develop/phone-numbers/manage/verified) to call them.
